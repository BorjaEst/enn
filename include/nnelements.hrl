%%% The cortex is a NN synchronizing element. It needs to know the PId of every neural network element, so that it will
%%% know when all the outputs have received their control inputs, and that itâ€™s time for the inputs to again gather
%%% and fanout input data to the neurons in the input layer. At the same time, the Cortex element can also act as a
%%% supervisor of all the Neuron, Input, and Output elements in the NN system.

%%% The neuron is a signal processing element. It accepts signals, accumulates them into an ordered vector, then
%%% processes this input vector to produce an output, and finally passes the output to other elements it is connected
%%% to. The Neuron never interacts with the environment directly, and even when it does receive signals and produces
%%% output signals, it does not know whether these input signals are coming from inputs or neurons, or whether it is
%%% sending its output signals to other neurons or outputs. All the neuron does is have a list of input PIds from
%%% which it expects to receive signals, a list of output PIds to which the neuron sends its output, a weight list
%%% correlated with the input PIds, and an activation function it applies to the dot product of the input vector and its
%%% weight vector. The neuron waits until it receives all the input signals, processes those signals, and then passes
%%% the output forward.
