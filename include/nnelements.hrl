%%% The cortex is a NN synchronizing element. It needs to know the PId of every neural network element, so that it will
%%% know when all the outputs have received their control inputs, and that itâ€™s time for the inputs to again gather
%%% and fanout input data to the neurons in the input layer. At the same time, the Cortex element can also act as a
%%% supervisor of all the Neuron, Input, and Output elements in the NN system.
